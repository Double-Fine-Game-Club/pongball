# Pongball

Pongball is a community developed game initially developed as a community activity across Double Fine's 2017 Amnesia Fortnight event, blending Pong and pinball gameplay in a frantic multiplayer experience.


## How to play

Deflect the ball with your paddle and attempt to score goals by getting the ball past your oppenents' paddles. Hitting bumpers and rollover targets (lightpads) increases the point value of goals.

Players can use special powers to affect play such as obscure, obstruct and slow. Powers are single use and randomly given every 20 seconds.
